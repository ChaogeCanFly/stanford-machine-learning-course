================================

These are my solutions for the Coursera Stanford Machine Learning course, by
Andrew Ng.

The exercises are those used during the January 22th - April 11th, 2016
session.

Please do not blindly copy my solutions if you are sitting the course, since
you won't learn anything that way.
I have posted them in the hope that can be a helpful resource to others if they
are stuck.

All solutions were written and tested in MATLAB 2015b, some also in
Octave 4.0.0.
