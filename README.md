================================

These are my solutions for the
[Coursera Stanford Machine Learning course][course], by Andrew Ng.

The exercises are those used during the January 22th - April 11th, 2016
session.

Please do not blindly copy my solutions if you are sitting the course, since
you won't learn anything that way.
I have posted them in the hope that can be a helpful resource to others if they
are stuck.

All solutions were written and tested in MATLAB 2015b, some also in
Octave 4.0.0.

For Octave 4.0.0, the submission script does not work out of the box, as discussed
[here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/vgCyrQoMEeWv5yIAC00Eog)
and
[here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/community/posts/204693179-linear-regression-submit-error),
and I have applied a patch to the submission encoding scripts as per
[this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6lXyE7fgSlXZjlqQ3FIRExmTDA/view)
and
[this](https://github.com/tumerbaatar/courseraml/blob/master/patch.py).
